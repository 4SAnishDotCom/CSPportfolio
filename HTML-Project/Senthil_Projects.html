                  For this project, where we worked in MIT App Inventor, me and my partner chose to modify a game called Space Invaders from a tutorial. Space Invaders is a game where a rocket ship has multiple bullets which it uses to shoot at a saucer, at the top of the screen. We decided to split up our plan into 3 tiers or rankings of which we needed to accomplish, and due to time constraints we managed to finish 2 tiers. From the basic Space Invaders that we started off with, we added another level, different obstacles, multiple shooters, and an introduction and conculsion to give our game a story element. I worked developing another level, different obstacles, and multiple shooters. We learned as a team that block based code cannot fulfil all the needs and is restricted, so we had to adapt and change our plan accordingly. In this project, I also had to analyze data from our feedback to further change our game to make it better and had to think of further problems based on our feedback that might affect our game and change that as well. All in all, me and my partner  had a good team dynamic and displayed consistant and good communication which really helped us achieve our main goal for this project.
